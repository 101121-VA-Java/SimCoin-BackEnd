*A cryptocurrency exchange simulator.*

Project length 12/6-12/27
<br /> Sam KC as scrum master, Kendrick Riley, Jason Melick, and Hannah Wallaker

# SimCoin Executive Summary
SimCoin is a single page application on which a user can practice their ability to trade cryptocurrencies. There are two types of users: Basic and VIP. Adding your email to the program makes you a VIP user with more ability to trade various currencies. The basic user may only trade bitcoin. You can watch your portfolio over time as you make financial trading decisions with real-time values of cryptos in USD.
<br/> 
<br/> The group worked in a three week sprint as a feature-based project. Points were assigned to each user story and stories were divided across the group. Each member carried the creation of their story from the backend all the way through the front.
